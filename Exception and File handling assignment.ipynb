    "An except block can also be used without specifying an exception type to catch all exceptions, though this is generally discouraged for better error management.\n",
    "3. else block (optional):\n",

    "It is useful for code that should only run when the try block completes successfully.\n",

    "This block executes unconditionally, regardless of whether an exception occurred in the try block or was handled by an except block.\n",
